# Buying IPv4 Addresses with [IPv4.Center](https://ipv4.center)

At **IPv4.Center**, we make buying IPv4 addresses easy, transparent, and secure. Our role as a broker is to connect you with trusted sellers, ensuring a smooth transaction process. We guide you through each step, from selecting the right IPv4 subnet to finalizing the transfer with the regional internet registry (RIPE NCC).

## How to Buy IPv4 Addresses

Here’s a step-by-step guide to buying IPv4 addresses through our platform:

### Step 1: Browse Available IPv4 Addresses

- We provide you with a list of IPv4 addresses available for sale in our inventory. Each listing includes details such as the size of the subnet and pricing information.
- You can review the available options and select the IPv4 address blocks that best meet your requirements.

### Step 2: Making an Offer

- Once you’ve identified the IPv4 subnet you are interested in, you can make an offer based on the listed price or propose your own price.
- We will communicate your offer to the seller and negotiate on your behalf. If the seller agrees to your offer, we proceed with the next steps. If not, we continue to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.

### Step 3: Contract and Escrow Setup

After reaching an agreement with the seller:

- We prepare a contract that outlines the terms of the sale. Both you and the seller will review and sign the contract.
- An escrow.com transaction is created to safeguard your funds. The transaction will have a specific release condition, such as the transfer of the IPv4 subnet’s organization ID (e.g., ORG-xxx-RIPE) to your company.

### Step 4: Securing Payment

- You transfer the agreed amount to escrow.com, which holds the funds securely until the transfer process is completed.
- Escrow.com ensures that your funds are safe and will only be released once all terms of the agreement are fulfilled.

### Step 5: Transfer Agreement

- A Transfer Agreement is drafted between you (the buyer) and the seller. This agreement is signed by both parties and is required for the transfer process.
- After both sides sign the agreement, the seller will initiate a Transfer Request with the regional internet registry (RIPE NCC).

### Step 6: RIPE Transfer Request

- The seller submits a Transfer Request to RIPE NCC, along with the signed Transfer Agreement.
- RIPE NCC reviews and processes the transfer, typically within 1-3 business days. Once RIPE approves the transfer, the IPv4 addresses are officially transferred to your organization.

### Step 7: Completing the Transaction

- Once the transfer is confirmed by RIPE and the specific release condition (such as the organization ID change) is met, escrow.com releases the funds to the seller.
- You will then receive the IPv4 address block as agreed, and the transaction will be finalized.
